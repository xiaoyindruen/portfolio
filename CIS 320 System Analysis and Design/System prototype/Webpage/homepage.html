<h1>What we do</h1>
<p>Most recently, the cupboard received a $1,000,000 donation from Commonwealth Credit Union 
over the next ten years. This generous donation will expand the cupboard’s opportunities to grow 
and will allow them to begin additional renovations to the pantry on May 3rd, 2021. The 
Commonwealth Credit Union Cardinal Cupboard Food Pantry has had an exciting two and a half 
years as a valuable resource to the cardinal community and will continue to provide service for 
years to come as a result of this donation.</p>
<p>To date, the cupboard has had more than 5,600 unique visitors and has been able to have an 
impact on over 13,300 people in the University of Louisville’s community. The cupboard is also 
the recipient of over 20,000 pounds of food and has helped divert nearly 10,000 pounds of food 
from being wasted and sent to the landfill.
